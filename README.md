NHF is an open-source ab initio quantum chemistry package.

I will teach you how to implement your own quantum chemistry program in the project [QuantumChemistryCpp](https://github.com/rudin-jiang/QuantumChemistryCpp#quantum-chemistry-cpp).

Unfortunately, I haven't learned how to write such a program myself. What's more unfortunate is that I don't have time to toss about these recently, and the enrollment pressure is too great.
